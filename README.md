# 🖼️ Image Processing from Scratch

This repository contains my journey of **learning Image Processing (IP)** by implementing fundamental algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy.  
Instead of relying heavily on OpenCV or other libraries, I focus on understanding the mathematics and coding the core operations myself.  

---

## 📌 Goals
- Learn how digital images are represented and manipulated.
- Implement basic image processing operations **step by step**.
- Compare my implementations with trusted libraries like `scipy` and `opencv` to verify correctness.

📝 Note

This project is for learning purposes. The code prioritizes clarity over performance. Libraries like OpenCV and SciPy are much faster and optimized for real-world use.
